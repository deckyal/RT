The result is available for our tracker trained on two sequences for 2D and 3DA-2D0VW and four sequences for Bounding Box tracking on 300V-W (which achieved the highest accuracy). 
If you need the other trained on other length (4,8,16 and 32) you can contact me via email : decky.aspandilatif@upf.edu
